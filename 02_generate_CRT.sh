  -p projectname

        String to identify the project or client. Only used to create a
        distinct folder to separate the generated files. This _projectname_
        won't be used in the generated certificates.

  -t certype

        Allowed values are 'server' or 'client'
        Choose 'server' to create a x509 file to be installed on your server
        Choose 'client' to create a pkcs12 file to be installed on your browser

  -n name

        String to be used in the Common Name (CN) of the generated certificates
        For 'server' type it should be the URL of the server
        For 'client' type it should be the FULLNAME of the end user
